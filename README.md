# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs and implement them into a program I will need to understand the client's vision for the product and what value the functions they are requiring will bring to the program's end user. Gathering this information will give me and the rest of the team a good foundation for what is necessary to implement into the program in order for it to be deemed successful by the client. Once this foundation is built, I can use the information to create user stories. User stories help to define requirements by observing them from the perspective of the end user; this keeps the value the user's desire to get from the functionalities at the top of the team's mind and makes sure their work is in line with the client's expectations.  

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Agile processes offer so much flexibility to program development. Personally, I'd like to incorporate the use of sprints in my future development work. Breaking functionalities down into minimal, bite-sized pieces makes a program more manageable and easier to adapt. This is especially attractive to someone newer to coding like me, who appreciates getting to take things a step at a time rather than trying to tackle the big picture all at once. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development, an individual must be self-organized and responsible for their actions. Since programs are ever-evolving, effective communication is key in software development. A self-organized and responsible team member will ensure they meet deadlines, such as the end of a sprint, and will communicate their progress or any roadblocks to their colleagues for honest feedback. Additionally, a good team member will feel a sense of personal ownership over the project and because of this, will always put their best efforts into the work they contribute.
